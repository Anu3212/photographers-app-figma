# photographers-app-figma
I designed an app using Figma that helps you find photographers based on your event.


**Basic Details for Designing an App Using Figma:**

1. Install Figma on your desktop.
2. Create a new design file for your idea.
3. At the bottom, youâ€™ll find options for frames, geometric symbols, text, etc.
4. Create a frame and add symbols based on your idea.
5. On the left side, you'll find the assets panel, which helps you find and add buttons, icons, and more.

**Wireframing:**

- After creating each page, click on "Prototype." This allows you to link buttons to their destination pages, creating interactive navigation.
